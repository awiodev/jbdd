# jBdd

Simple BDD abstraction especially for integration/component tests!

This library has been created for the purpose of writing business oriented integration and component tests.

These days BDD is pretty commonly used concept but let's be honest, current frameworks are not very warm welcomed by software developers.
In most of the cases using frameworks like Cucumber on integration/component level is painful for software developers.
We want to implement our tests quickly!

This library tries to address this problem. It provides an abstraction layer allowing to implement BDD like tests.

It also contains extensions allowing to generate nice tests reports that follows BDD concept.

Current implementation is focused on delivering generic BDD steps, JUnit extension, rest operations, reporting wrappers and SpringBoot configuration classes.

Please fell free to contribute if you need jBdd in other areas!
